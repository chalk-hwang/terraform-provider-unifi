# Unifi Provider

The Unifi provider allows users to manage and configure UniFi Network controllers and devices via the Terraform ecosystem. This provider is currently **under active development** and should be considered **experimental**.

## Important Warning

This provider is **not yet fully functional** and is **under construction**. Only limited features are thoroughly tested and confirmed to work. Users should be aware that certain features may work inconsistently or may not work at all. It is recommended to use this provider for **testing and experimentation purposes only**, rather than in production environments.

## Supported UniFi Controller Version

This provider currently works with **UniFi Controller v8.4.59**. Efforts are ongoing to ensure compatibility with the latest UniFi Network Controller versions.

## Features Currently Working

The following features are thoroughly tested and confirmed to work:

- **Resource: Network** - Manage UniFi network configurations.
- **Resource: Port Profile** - Configure port profiles for UniFi switches.

## Fork Information

This provider is a fork of the original [paultyng/terraform-provider-unifi](https://github.com/paultyng/terraform-provider-unifi). The original provider supports UniFi Network versions up to **v7.4.162**. For users requiring compatibility with older UniFi Network versions, please use the [paultyng provider on the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/paultyng/unifi/latest).

## Authentication Recommendations
It is not recommended to use your own account for management of your controller. A user specific to
Terraform is recommended. You can create a **Limited Admin** with **Local Access Only** and
provide that information for authentication. Two-factor authentication is not supported in the provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "unifi" {
  username = var.username # optionally use UNIFI_USERNAME env var
  password = var.password # optionally use UNIFI_PASSWORD env var
  api_url  = var.api_url  # optionally use UNIFI_API env var

  # you may need to allow insecure TLS communications unless you have configured
  # certificates for your controller
  allow_insecure = var.insecure # optionally use UNIFI_INSECURE env var

  # if you are not configuring the default site, you can change the site
  # site = "foo" or optionally use UNIFI_SITE env var
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `allow_insecure` (Boolean) Skip verification of TLS certificates of API requests. You may need to set this to `true` if you are using your local API without setting up a signed certificate. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_INSECURE` environment variable.
- `api_url` (String) URL of the controller API. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_API` environment variable. You should **NOT** supply the path (`/api`), the SDK will discover the appropriate paths. This is to support UDM Pro style API paths as well as more standard controller paths.
- `password` (String) Password for the user accessing the API. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_PASSWORD` environment variable.
- `site` (String) The site in the Unifi controller this provider will manage. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_SITE` environment variable. Default: `default`
- `username` (String) Local user name for the Unifi controller API. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_USERNAME` environment variable.
